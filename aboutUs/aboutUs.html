			<h1>About Us</h1><p>Based in Clondalkin, Co. Dublin, Janacraft was founded in 2024 by Ana and Jessica with the aim of helping people break their addiction to their gadgets by offering different fun activities such as painting,crafting and book reading amongst others. We know how people have become addicted to their phones, Ipads and laptops and how  detrimental such addiction is, thus, the birthing of this initiative.</p>
			<p>At JanaCraft,we have someting for everyone. Our book club community which anyone can become a member upon registering has become a hit as people are seeking to get away from gadgets and improve their social skills. Also,crafting clubs are available for those who do not like book clubs.</p>
			<p>The centre was established to help people claim back their lives and relationships,therefore, we are open to any suggestions from our customers on how best to serve them, whether by adding more activities or improving the already existing ones.</p>
			<p>We currently stock over 700 books, crafts and puzzles and our team is constantly looking out for more quality materials that will make transition easier for people. Our website is up and running and we endeavour to respond to queries as soon as possible.</p>
			<p>We hope all our customers have a fun and satistying time kicking this addiction to the curb. Remember, you can do whatever you set your mind to do.</p>
